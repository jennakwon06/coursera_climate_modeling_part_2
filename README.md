# coursera_climate_modeling_part_2


### Week 1: "Time Stepping Naked Planet Model": naked_planet.py 
The goal of the assignment is to numerically simulate the evolution of planetary temperature of a "naked" planet through time. "Naked" means that we aren't accounting for the atmospheric layers that causes greenhouse effect. 

The planet starts with initial temperature, and its heat capacity is determined by a layer of water which absorbs heat and changes its temperature.

Every time step, heat content is extrapolated from one step to the next using incoming and outgoing heat fluxes. 

### Week 2: snowball.py  
The goal of the assignment is to use iterations to find consistent values of albedo and temperature in order to show the effect of ice albedo feedback on Earth's temperature. 


### Week 3: ice_sheet.py


### Week 4: shallow.py


### Week 5: without_us.py
